Welcome to RTD Tutorial documentation!
===================================

**RTD Tutorial** (ReadTheDocs Tutorial) is a test documentation site for checking how docs-as-code tools work.
It is currently located at the URL `RTD Tutorial Docs <https://haplio-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/>`_

This sentence is here just to test our local build of the docs

*This is how we do italics*

This is how we link to named pages in our repo like: :doc:`next-begin`

This is how we link to named headings anywhere in our doc: :ref:`subheading_1`

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
